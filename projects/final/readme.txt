The data is retrieved from a fan-owned overwatch api which I cloned over to my
heroku. I didn't really have time to add other regions like EU, so only NA is
supported. All the tabs should be straight forward but some interesting notes
is that the image on the "competitive" tab changes based on your current skill
rating in the game.

The history tab uses the indexDB as requested and stores people you've visited
before. A compare function was planned but I couldn't get to it.

I've shown it to my friends and the feedback I got was that it looked really 
sleek but lacked features. Which is understandable as the data is limited.
